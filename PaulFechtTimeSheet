Week 2: 2-5 to 2/9 
Mon: We met at the house.(address undisclosed except to participants in group text).
     Meeting was delayed until about 7:15pm due to my obligation to take the Praxis Computer science exam.
     Attendees were: Phil, Jake and myself. Pizza was made available to the attendees
     Worked on getting the development environment setup on Phil's computer(Windows).
     The entire Zumo robot with Seeeduino was assembeled and is working.
     We learned that the Seeeduino needs a micro USB cord and not all cords are created equally.
     Having some problem with the noise, as the robot wakes up and seems to be erratic in its behavior.
     Phil mentioned that he believed the environment was too noisy.
     WAITING: Word back from the Wyoming Space Grant Consortium.  The signs are promising for a $500 educator grant.
     If the grant is obtained we need to determine how to wisely, spend the funds for the most effect.
     TODO: Test training the robot in a less noisy color environment.
     TODO: Try out the robot on the gripper/non-slip material
     TODO: Complete the Mac development environment setup.
     TODO: Where do we go from here?  How do we upscale the robot?  What did we learn from the small robot?

Week 1: 1-29 to 2/2 (Groundhog Day)
Mon: We met in Engineering 2011(or something).
     Talked about the standup meetings a.k.a. SCRUM
     I forgot my glasses.  Finally had them brought to me
     After quite some time was able to perform the pan/tilt demo with
     the PixyMon Software.  
     TODO: Need to figure out how to get the Arduino talking with the Pixy Camera.(The code does this)
     DID: Wrote to Wyoming space grant consortium asking for an educator grant to help with expenses.
     TODO: Need to put together the Zumo Arduino platform.

Week 0: 1-22-2018 
and then I did more . . .
