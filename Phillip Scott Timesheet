Week 2:
  Met with paul and jake. Installed pixymon and arduino IDE downloaded on my laptop. 
  Built robot. Seems to work but needs some adjustment. It doesn't follow the ball the way it's supposed to.
  Possible environment issues. The robot kepy looking directly up at the lightbulbs instead of the
  tennis ball. Gonna need to do some more testing to get it working the way it needs to be. Possibly do
  some testing in a more natural environment (the tennis court).

Week 1
  (3 hours)
  Mostly met with group and discussed meeting times and split up work. Did some research into software of bot; mostly how to get the bot to recognize a ball and movement.
