Week 3:
  Getting the robot to follow a ball seems to be more of a challenge than expected. Doing some research into configuring
  pixycam to follow the ball more efficiently. Also, doing some research into running our own motors from the arduino 
  so we can scale the robot up from its small version. 

Week 2:
  Met with paul and jake. Installed pixymon and arduino IDE downloaded on my laptop. 
  Built robot. Seems to work but needs some adjustment. It doesn't follow the ball the way it's supposed to.
  Possible environment issues. The robot kepy looking directly up at the lightbulbs instead of the
  tennis ball. Gonna need to do some more testing to get it working the way it needs to be. Possibly do
  some testing in a more natural environment (the tennis court).

Week 1
  (3 hours)
  Mostly met with group and discussed meeting times and split up work. Did some research into software of bot; mostly how to get the bot to recognize a ball and movement.
